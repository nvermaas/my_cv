# CV

This is my Curriculum Vitae and portfolio of software engineering projects.
Written as a Single Page Application in ReactJS, but without a backend server.

The content is almost fully defined in a single `StaticConfig.js` file, 
with all the static images stored in a single `public\assets` directory.

This makes the application itself almost a lightweight Content Management System (CMS) 
which can potentially be used for building similar websites.
